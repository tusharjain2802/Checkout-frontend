### Functioning
- Integrated API which gives the response of a randomized cart as well as the Payment Methods.
- In case of empty product list render No Data Found popup.
- users can choose their preferred payment method and switch between methods seamlessly.
- Confirmation page with displaying the order details, selected payment method, and a status message indicating the success or failure of the transaction.


### Additional Challenge
- We can customize the colour scheme, logo, and overall styling of the application.
